sda-timezones
=============

Timezones for SpeedDemosArchive's Awesome Games Done Quick.

Awesome games done quick is a thing Speed Demos Archive does a couple of times a year to benefit different charities.

This is just a simple patch to add a timezone selector but keep everything else intact.

Usually available at http://speeddemosarchive.com/marathon/

What it does
============

Adds a select box to the current schedule page so that you can view what times things happen, local to you.

You can also link to specific timezones by adding etc #2 for UTC+2.

Where to see

Of course i hope the good folks over at Speed Demos Archive use my code so that everyone can benefit but in case you just want to do a quick check, a mirror is available at http://www.kokarn.com/sda/
